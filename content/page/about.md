Hello! My name is Ross Kirkpatrick.

I am a Senior Software Engineer working remotely from Western Pennsylvania. I am an open-source proponent who comes from an operations background where I spent the first few years of my career working as a Linux Systems Engineer. I spent a few years working exclusively in Azure GovCloud where I designed, implemented, and supported FedRAMP Moderate and High, HITRUST, and DoD IL5 environments and customers. I took this security experience and started my journey with containers (and kubernetes) at Rancher as a Support Engineer. I became the Windows Containerization SME at Rancher and took my knowledge to the upstream Kubernetes community via sig-windows. Kubernetes on Windows became a passion project while working at Rancher, which culminated into a promotion to a Software Engineer working on the Rancher Windows Engineering team. As a part of that team, I co-authored and delivered the first to market Windows containerd Kubernetes distribution (RKE2).
